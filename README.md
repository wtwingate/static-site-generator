# static-site-generator

A static site generator built in Python.

## Purpose

This is one of the guided projects included in the Boot.dev curriculum. The purpose is to practice some of the core programming concepts I've been learning. Since this is a guided project, the instructor provided a high-level overview of how to approach the project, but it was up to me to implement my own solutions to the various problems presented.
